# 个人化轻记录风格

## 核心特点

- 口吻亲切自然
  用口语化表达（如 “I always feel that...”“Hi, here I am :)”）和表情符号营造轻松的对话感，像与读者闲聊近况，无正式写作的距离感。

- 内容聚焦个人实践
  以 “个人建博客的经历” 为线索，从 “曾想拥有博客却未行动” 到 “尝试工具、发现新平台”，再到 “未来计划”，全程围绕自身行动和体验，更像 “过程记录” 而非 “观点输出”。

- 细节具体且克制
  提及工具（如 Gridsome、Forestry.io）时，聚焦具体功能细节（如 <static-query> 特性、Git-backed CMS 机制），用 “解决了我的痛点”“符合我的需求” 等个人感受替代夸张评价，情绪表达藏于细节中。

- 姿态开放谦逊
  结尾以 “网站仍在开发中，欢迎提建议” 收尾，弱化 “权威感”，更像一次 “尝试分享” 而非 “成果展示”。

## 参考语言风格

I always feel that I need a blog but I never have one.

So I took some time to rewrite my homepage and adding the blog section. and Hi, here I am :)

This time I gave a try on Gridsome and it works petty well. I do love the <static-query> custom block that works even in components. The progressive image also solves my years of pain in making a photography portfolio (and I have never finished one).

While I was browsing Gridsome’s starter templates, I found a great website Forestry.io. It’s a Git-backed CMS that I can write and manage my blog posts in a nice GUI website and then commit back to GitHub. This is the feature that I wish to have for a long time, did not expect to see such a well built and nicely designed service out there.

As for the blog, I am likely to do some bilingual stuff in the future. Some posts will be written in English, some might be in Chinese. A switch button will be shown then. Also planned to post my photos in this site, which I would need to implement the gallery page for it.

The site is still WIP, if you have any thoughts or suggestions, please tell me via email or on Twitter. Thanks!

:)
