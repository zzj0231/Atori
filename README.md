## Atori

This platform serves as a space where I:

- Share technical articles and hobby practices
- Write reviews about favorite animes and books
- Record random musings from life

[Atori](https://atori-ckjg.vercel.app/) is inspired by the anime "[ATRI-My Dear Moments](https://atri-animation.com/)"。In the future, the project also plans to incorporate AI capabilities, to make Atori as intelligent and emotionally responsive as its anime namesake.
